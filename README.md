# MERN Weekday-2: Weekly Assignments (Week 3)

This repository contains the solutions to the assignments for Week 3 of the MERN weekday course. The assignments focus on fundamental JavaScript concepts and DOM manipulation techniques. Below is a brief overview of each assignment and the corresponding solution.

## Assignment Overview

### Q1: Sort Three Numbers
**Objective:** Write a JavaScript conditional statement to sort three numbers and display the result in an alert box.

**Solution:**
The solution involves capturing three numbers from the user, sorting them using conditional statements, and displaying the sorted order in an alert box.

### Q2: Slideshow
**Objective:** Write a JavaScript program to create a slideshow that changes the displayed image when a next or previous button is clicked.

**Solution:**
The solution uses JavaScript to change the `src` attribute of an `img` element when the next or previous buttons are clicked. The images are stored in an array, and the current index is updated accordingly.

### Q3: Add Rows to a Table
**Objective:** Write a JavaScript function to add rows to a table.

**Solution:**
The solution includes a function that takes user input and appends a new row with that data to an existing HTML table.

### Q4: Visit DOM Elements
**Objective:** Create a function that visits a given DOM element and all of its descendants, passing each element to a provided callback function.

**Solution:**
The solution features a recursive function that traverses the DOM tree starting from the given element and applies the callback function to each element.

### Q5: Add New Elements Dynamically
**Objective:** Write the code for adding new elements dynamically to the DOM.

**Solution:**
The solution demonstrates how to create and append new HTML elements (e.g., `div`, `p`) to the DOM using JavaScript.
